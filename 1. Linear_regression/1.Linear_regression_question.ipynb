        "Predicting housing prices holds significant importance for various stakeholders in the real estate market. Homeowners can leverage this information to make informed decisions about selling, determining listing prices, and deciding on property investments. For potential buyers, understanding housing prices aids in making informed choices about suitable properties, crafting reasonable offers, and assessing affordability. Real estate professionals rely on accurate price predictions to assist clients in buying or selling homes and making strategic investment decisions. Machine learning, with its ability to provide precise and reliable estimates, emerges as a valuable tool for enhancing housing price predictions compared to traditional methods.\n",

We're essentially testing different combinations of *weight* and *bias* to pinpoint the sweet spot, where our model is optimized for success. It's like finding the perfect balance to make our model predict outcomes as accurately as possible. So, let's dive into the visuals and witness how these simple adjustments can lead us to a better, more efficient model."
